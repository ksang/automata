# automata
A network performance testing and visualization tool based on netperf and RRUL(Real-Time Response Under Load)

## Why
Inspired by [Flent](https://flent.org/index.html), it is nice to have a network performance testing and visualization tool with time series data. This tool is intend to solve below problems of flent:
* Complexity of parameters and configurations
* Many ports and protocols needs to be opened

This tool is easy to use and only requires `netperf` ports (12865/tcp, 12866/tcp, 12866/udp) to be opened so can be easily integrated with firewall environment or Micro Services Architecture

## Output example
This is an example of RRUL testing result on localhost:

## How

Below are quick start instructions

#### Requirements
netperf with demo feature enabled (`â€“enable-demo=yes`)

	apt-get update && apt-get install net-perf

#### Build binary
	make
#### On Server
	netserver
#### On Client
	./build/automata -host <Server_Address> -o result.png
#### Client usage
	Usage of ./build/automata:
	  -P uint
	    	netserver data port (default 12866)
	  -host string
	    	netserver address e.g "192.168.100.100" (default "127.0.0.1")
	  -l uint
	    	time in seconds the test will last (default 30)
	  -o string
	    	output filename of plotting, print csv data if not provided
	  -p uint
	    	netserver control port (default 12865)
#### Docker, Kubernetes and Istio
A netperf netserver image can be pulled from:

	docker pull ksang/netserver

Example of using this image within kubernetes and istio:
